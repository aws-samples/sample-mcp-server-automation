# Example: Using command override and environment variables
# This configuration demonstrates the recently added features for customizing MCP server commands

build:
  github_url: "https://github.com/awslabs/mcp"
  subfolder: "src/aws-documentation-mcp-server"
  
  # NEW FEATURE: Command Override
  # Override the detected start command with a custom command
  # This is useful when:
  # - The auto-detection fails to find the correct command
  # - You need custom arguments or flags
  # - You want to use a different entry point
  command_override:
    - "python"
    - "-m"
    - "aws_documentation_mcp_server"
    - "--verbose"
  
  # NEW FEATURE: Environment Variables
  # Set custom environment variables in the Docker container
  # These will be available to the MCP server at runtime
  environment_variables:
    LOG_LEVEL: "debug"
    AWS_REGION: "us-east-1"
    MCP_SERVER_NAME: "aws-docs-custom"
