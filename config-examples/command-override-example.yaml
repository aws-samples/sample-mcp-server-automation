# Example: Using command override and environment variables
# This configuration demonstrates command override, which is required when:
# - README only contains Docker commands
# - No suitable startup command can be auto-detected
# - You want to specify custom arguments or flags

build:
  github_url: "https://github.com/awslabs/mcp"
  subfolder: "src/aws-documentation-mcp-server"
  
  # Command Override - Required when README has only Docker commands
  # The tool will throw an error if it can't find a suitable non-Docker command
  # and no command_override is provided
  command_override:
    - "python"
    - "-m"
    - "aws_documentation_mcp_server"
    - "--verbose"
  
  # NEW FEATURE: Environment Variables
  # Set custom environment variables in the Docker container
  # These will be available to the MCP server at runtime
  environment_variables:
    LOG_LEVEL: "debug"
    AWS_REGION: "us-east-1"
    MCP_SERVER_NAME: "aws-docs-custom"
    PYTHONPATH: "/app/mcp-server:/custom/path"
